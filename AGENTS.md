# Agent instructions

Coding agents working in this repository must follow **mandatory ctxo MCP workflow** before reading or changing source files. Tooling and evidence-gathering rules override assumptions. The behavioral guidelines below complement that workflow: they bias toward **caution over speed**. For trivial tasks (obvious one-liners, typos), use judgment—not every step needs full rigor.

## ctxo MCP Tool Usage (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS use ctxo MCP tools before reading source files or making code changes.** The ctxo index contains dependency graphs, git intent, anti-patterns, and change health that cannot be derived from reading files alone. Skipping these tools leads to blind edits and broken dependencies.

### Before ANY Code Modification

1. Call `get_blast_radius` for the symbol you are about to change — understand what breaks
2. Call `get_why_context` for the same symbol — check for revert history or anti-patterns
3. Only then read and edit source files

### Before Starting a Task

| Task Type                  | REQUIRED First Call                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Fixing a bug               | `get_context_for_task(taskType: "fix")`        |
| Adding/extending a feature | `get_context_for_task(taskType: "extend")`     |
| Refactoring                | `get_context_for_task(taskType: "refactor")`   |
| Understanding code         | `get_context_for_task(taskType: "understand")` |

### Before Reviewing a PR or Diff

- Call `get_pr_impact` — single call gives full risk assessment with co-change analysis

### When Exploring or Searching Code

- Use `search_symbols` for name/regex lookup — DO NOT grep source files for symbol discovery
- Use `get_ranked_context` for natural language queries — DO NOT manually browse directories

### Orientation in Unfamiliar Areas

- Call `get_architectural_overlay` to understand layer boundaries
- Call `get_symbol_importance` to identify critical symbols

### NEVER Do These

- NEVER edit a function without first calling `get_blast_radius` on it
- NEVER skip `get_why_context` — reverted code and anti-patterns are invisible without it
- NEVER grep source files to find symbols when `search_symbols` exists
- NEVER manually trace imports when `find_importers` gives the full reverse dependency graph

## Behavioral guidelines

Reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific Cursor rules and skills as needed.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
